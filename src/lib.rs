//! RGB20 library for working with fungible asset types, operating under
//! schemata, defined with LNPBP-20 standard:
//! - Root RGB20 schema, returned by [`schema::schema()`] with id
//!   [`SCHEMA_ID_BECH32`]
//! - RGB20 subschema, returned by [`schema::subschema()`], prohibiting asset
//!   replacement procedure and having id [`SUBSCHEMA_ID_BECH32`]
//! - High-level RGB20 API performing asset issuance, transfers and other
//!   asset-management operations
